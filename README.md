This project is a simple mobile app.

Goal:
Help a Korean wife and a Tunisian mother communicate respectfully.

Main idea:
- The user speaks.
- The app listens.
- The app reformulates the message in a respectful and safe way.
- The user confirms before sending.

This app is for family harmony, not literal translation.
